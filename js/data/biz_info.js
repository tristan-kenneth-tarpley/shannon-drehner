        <p>Violent crime and assault involves cases where an individual uses or threatens the use of
        force upon another individual. Assaults and violent crimes range from class C
        misdemeanors to first degree felonies. The punishments range from fines/no jail to life
        imprisonment. Shannon has extensive experience in violent crime litigation.  Shannon was
        a chief prosecutor in the Organized Crime Division working side by side with homicide and
        robbery detectives. She tried violent crime cases from assaults to capital murders. 
        </p>
        <p>Shannon knows that clients charged with these cases will face aggressive prosecutors.  The
        consequences of a violent crimes allegation could mean you lose your job, reputation,
        important relationships, and your freedom. In allegations of violence, it’s important to look
        at the facts because details matter. Shannon knows the difference between a well
        investigated case and one where shortcuts are taken. When inexperience, an overburdened
        system, and sheer laziness come together, criminal charges of violence can result that are
        without merit or exaggerated. Shannon knows how to fight back against exaggerated or
        false claims of violence.</p>
        <p>
        With so much at stake, you need an attorney who can investigate the claims against you. If
        the charges progress, you need an attorney who has the experience, skill, and tenacity to get
        the best result possible.

        <p>White collar crime often involves non-violent offenses committed through deceptive
        practices, for the purpose of financial gain. Typically, white collar crimes are committed by
        persons in business who are able to handle or move large amounts of money.  The term also
        applies to people who pilfer monies in other fraudulent circumstances. People accused of
        white collar crimes can range from CEOs and executives to small business owners and
        employees. They are doctors, accountants, and even lawyers.  Charges can result in the loss
        of a career and even a lifetime of prison.  </p>
        <p>Shannon knows that a client charged with a white collar crime is entitled to a vigorous
        defense.  Often times a white collar investigation is complex and thorough. The government
        will impose huge monetary fines and long prison sentences for persons accused of white
        collar fraud. </p>
         <p>It is important to get an attorney involved in the investigative phase if possible. However,
        Shannon is ready to take on a case at any stage of a case. 
        Shannon has worked extensively in the organized crime division and special crimes
        division. As such, she is familiar with white collar crimes and can protect her clients
        accordingly. If possible, Shannon will work to resolve or dispose of the case in the
        preliminary stages before an indictment is secured. However, if a trial is necessary to
        protect your interests, you need someone with trial experience, skill, and credibility to try
        your case.</p>

        enforcement community and is a well respected lawyer by these groups.  Quite often, the

        Shannon knows that not every crime victim is given the full attention they deserve from the
        law enforcement community.  This can be for a variety of reasons - the police might be
        overwhelmed or the case may be too complex.</p>
        <p>If you are a victim of a criminal offense or fraud scheme, Shannon can help you investigate
        your case. She can present it in a way that gets attention from police investigators.  As a

        <h5>Aggressive and Passionate Criminal Defense for Sexual Assault Charges</h5>

        <p>If you are charged with sexual assault, the consequences can range from probation to a life sentence
        depending on the charge. In addition, Texas has sex offender registration requirements upon a plea or
        conviction of certain sexual assault charges.</p>
        <p>Just the mere allegation of a sex crime can have ramifications for one’s career, personal relationships,
        and reputation. Attorney Shannon Drehner knows just how much is on the line when someone is
        falsely accused of sexual assault or misconduct. Whether you are currently under investigation, or
        already charged, an effective and solid defense is necessary to protect your reputation, career, and
        freedom. </p>
        <p>Having prosecuted and investigated countless sexual assault cases, attorney Shannon Drehner knows
        that oftentimes sexual assault cases are put together without thorough investigation. This maybe
        because of the inexperience of the police officer, an overwhelmed system, a persuasive victim, or
        pure laziness. Aside from trying sexual assault cases, attorney Shannon Drehner has worked in both
        the criminal intake division and special crimes division. This is where police investigators present
        charges and await filing decisions. Attorney Shannon Drehner knows what can and should be done by
        law enforcement when investigating an allegation of sexual assault. As your attorney, Shannon
        Drehner will use her experience to aggressively defend against false allegations of sexual assault. </p>

        <h5 style="color: #669acc;" >Why a Female Defense Attorney Maybe in Your Best Interest</h5>

        <p>Sexual Assault is one of the few crimes in Texas where someone can be charged with zero evidence,
        relying solely on testimonials. It’s the proverbial he said/she said case. Juries are told that they can
        base their conviction exclusively on the words of the accuser if they find them credible.  A simple “he
        did it” can doom a person to life in prison and a life of registration as a sex offender. This oftentimes
        puts the accused at a great disadvantage. 
        <p>In sex crimes cases the devil is in the details. Minute details of an event become important. At the end
        of the day, everything whittles down to determining the credibility of the parties involved.  There are
        times when tough, personal questions must be asked of the accuser. Oftentimes a male attorney
        asking these questions can come across as a bully, especially when asking questions of someone who
        comes across as sympathetic.</p>
        <p>Attorney Shannon Drehner has the demeanor to ask the tough questions without coming across as
        offensive. In any trial case, the challenging of the state’s evidence by an attorney that comes across as credibility is the key to victory. This is especially true for sexual assault cases. Attorney Shannon
        Drehner has the experience, poise, and credibility that is needed when so much is at stake.</p>

        <p>Youths are susceptible to making mistakes, especially when influenced by peer pressure.
        Oftentimes what others may call youthful misconduct results in a youth being formally
        charged in a juvenile court. This could have profound impact on their future, effecting
        their ability to be accepted at a university as well as the military. It is a myth that all
        juvenile convictions are sealed and the that authorities wouldn’t have access to it in the
        future. It is important to guarantee that the records are eventually sealed so that it does not
        affect your child’s future. Your family and especially your child deserves an experienced
        attorney to guide them through the juvenile court system. </p>
        <p>The juvenile justice system is supposed to be designed to rehabilitate the youth. Attorney
        Shannon Drehner’s approach to dealing with juvenile offenders is to work closely with
        them along with their family members.  Each individual case is different - careful attention
        must be made to decide the best solution. Sometimes it&#39;s better to challenge the charge,
        while other times you should simply find the most favorable outcome for the child. If your
        child did make a mistake, attorney Shannon Drehner’s goal is to find the best possible
        outcome for the offender. This means getting them the help they need while minimizing
        punitive action.  How we resolve their first case usually decides whether this will be a one-
        time occurrence or the beginning of more run-ins with the law. Attorney Shannon Drehner
        is prepared to deal with any issues related to juvenile charges including: </p>
        <ul>

        <p>Family violence cases involve crimes committed by one person against another in any type
        of familial or domestic relationship. This includes people who are married or in a personal
        relationship, family members, and individuals in the same household. If you are arrested or
        under investigation for a family violence case, the consequences can range from probation
        to life in prison. The sentence depends on the specific nature of the charge, injuries, and
        prior acts of family violence. Just the mere allegation of a family violence charge can have a
        negative stigma.  It can lead to losing a job, forfeiting your right to possess a firearm, and

        <p>Accusations of domestic violence surface around jealousy, alcohol consumption,
        accusations of infidelity, and overall unhappiness. Most of the time, these accusations do
        not surface in a vacuum. An officer responding to a domestic violence call must decide on
        the spot who is in the wrong or the aggressor. Most of the time, they don’t have all the
        information. Shannon had handled hundreds of family violence cases in her career. She
        knows that often times officers and prosecutors who make charging decision don’t have all
        the information to make a reasoned decision. </p>

        title: 'Expunctions and Petitions for Non-Disclosure',
        copy: `
        <p>Expungement refers to the process of clearing a prior arrest or verdict. This gives you the
        right to legally deny you were arrested or convicted. In addition, potential employers won&#39;t
        find the arrest or conviction during background checks. This is important because a
        criminal record can prevent you from finding a job, obtaining credit, or owning a gun. 
        A petition for non-disclosure works in a similar fashion. An order of non-disclosure
        prohibits police departments and clerk’s offices from disclosing certain criminal records.
        This means that private groups and individuals cannot access a previous criminal record.
        However, a wide range of government agencies and licensing boards may still have access
        to the criminal records. </p>
        <p>Attorney Shannon Drehner can help you determine you can apply for an expungement or a
        petition for non-disclosure. There are situations where it is granted after meeting certain
        requirements. Other times, it is the judge&#39;s decision. As a chief prosecutor, Shannon made
        recommendations to the judge as to whether the granting of petitions for non-disclosure or
        expunctions were appropriate. If you need an expunction or a petition for non-disclosure,

        <p>Drug charges are one of the most commonly filed criminal charges. They range in severity
        depending on the type and amount of drugs recovered. Charges can be filed in both state
        court and federal court. Penalties range from fines to probation to life in prison depending
        on the charge and any possible enhancement provisions. Harsher punishments tend to be
        given to individuals who sell or distribute drugs as opposed to simple possession. 
        Just because you have been arrested for drug possession or distribution does not mean that
        it is the end of the road. If you have been arrested for a drug offense, you need someone
        with the knowledge and experience to handle drug charges at every level. At a basic level,
        an aggressive defense to a drug charge requires an attorney to challenge the following:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Basis of the stop or encounter with a police officer</li>
            <li>Right of the police officer to search an individual/vehicle/property</li>
            <li>Right of an officer to ask questions of a subject without providing legal warnings
            and without the benefit of an attorney</li>
