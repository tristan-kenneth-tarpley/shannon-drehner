    assault: `<p>Violent crime and assault involve cases where an individual uses or threatens the use of
    force upon another individual. Assaults and violent crimes range from class C
    misdemeanors to first degree felonies. The punishments range from fines/no jail to life
    imprisonment. Shannon has extensive experience in violent crime litigation.  Shannon was
    a chief prosecutor in the Organized Crime Division working side by side with homicide and
    robbery detectives. She tried violent crime cases from assaults to capital murders. 
    </p>
    <p>Shannon knows that clients charged with these cases will face aggressive prosecutors.  The
    consequences of a violent crimes allegation could mean you lose your job, reputation,
    important relationships, and your freedom. In allegations of violence, it’s important to look
    at the facts because details matter. Shannon knows the difference between a well
    investigated case and one where shortcuts are taken. When inexperience, an overburdened
    system, and sheer laziness come together, criminal charges of violence can result that are
    without merit or exaggerated. Shannon knows how to fight back against exaggerated or
    false claims of violence.</p>
    <p>
    With so much at stake, you need an attorney who can investigate the claims against you. If
    the charges progress, you need an attorney who has the experience, skill, and tenacity to get
    the best result possible.
