        <p>Violent crime and assault involves cases where an individual uses or threatens the use of
        force upon another individual. Assaults and violent crimes range from class C
        misdemeanors to first degree felonies. The punishments range from fines/no jail to life
        imprisonment. Shannon has extensive experience in violent crime litigation.  Shannon was
        a chief prosecutor in the Organized Crime Division working side by side with homicide and
        robbery detectives. She tried violent crime cases from assaults to capital murders. 
        </p>
        <p>Shannon knows that clients charged with these cases will face aggressive prosecutors.  The
        consequences of a violent crimes allegation could mean you lose your job, reputation,
        important relationships, and your freedom. In allegations of violence, it’s important to look
        at the facts because details matter. Shannon knows the difference between a well
        investigated case and one where shortcuts are taken. When inexperience, an overburdened
        system, and sheer laziness come together, criminal charges of violence can result that are
        without merit or exaggerated. Shannon knows how to fight back against exaggerated or
        false claims of violence.</p>
        <p>
        With so much at stake, you need an attorney who can investigate the claims against you. If
        the charges progress, you need an attorney who has the experience, skill, and tenacity to get
        the best result possible.

        <p>White collar crime often involves non-violent offenses committed through deceptive
        practices, for the purpose of financial gain. Typically, white collar crimes are committed by
        persons in business who are able to handle or move large amounts of money.  The term also
        applies to people who pilfer monies in other fraudulent circumstances. People accused of
        white collar crimes can range from CEOs and executives to small business owners and
        employees. They are doctors, accountants, and even lawyers.  Charges can result in the loss
        of a career and even a lifetime of prison.  </p>
        <p>Shannon knows that a client charged with a white collar crime is entitled to a vigorous
        defense.  Often times a white collar investigation is complex and thorough. The government
        will impose huge monetary fines and long prison sentences for persons accused of white
        collar fraud. </p>
         <p>It is important to get an attorney involved in the investigative phase if possible. However,
        Shannon is ready to take on a case at any stage of a case. 
        Shannon has worked extensively in the organized crime division and special crimes
        division. As such, she is familiar with white collar crimes and can protect her clients
        accordingly. If possible, Shannon will work to resolve or dispose of the case in the
        preliminary stages before an indictment is secured. However, if a trial is necessary to
        protect your interests, you need someone with trial experience, skill, and credibility to try
        your case.</p>

        <h5>Aggressive and Passionate Criminal Defense for Sexual Assault Charges</h5>

        <p>If you are charged with sexual assault, the consequences can range from probation to a life sentence
        depending on the charge. In addition, Texas has sex offender registration requirements upon a plea or
        conviction of certain sexual assault charges.</p>
        <p>Just the mere allegation of a sex crime can have ramifications for one’s career, personal relationships,
        and reputation. Attorney Shannon Drehner knows just how much is on the line when someone is
        falsely accused of sexual assault or misconduct. Whether you are currently under investigation, or
        already charged, an effective and solid defense is necessary to protect your reputation, career, and
        freedom. </p>
        <p>Having prosecuted and investigated countless sexual assault cases, attorney Shannon Drehner knows
        that oftentimes sexual assault cases are put together without thorough investigation. This maybe
        because of the inexperience of the police officer, an overwhelmed system, a persuasive victim, or
        pure laziness. Aside from trying sexual assault cases, attorney Shannon Drehner has worked in both
        the criminal intake division and special crimes division. This is where police investigators present
        charges and await filing decisions. Attorney Shannon Drehner knows what can and should be done by
        law enforcement when investigating an allegation of sexual assault. As your attorney, Shannon
        Drehner will use her experience to aggressively defend against false allegations of sexual assault. </p>

        <h5 style="color: #669acc;" >Why a Female Defense Attorney Maybe in Your Best Interest</h5>

        <p>Sexual Assault is one of the few crimes in Texas where someone can be charged with zero evidence,
        relying solely on testimonials. It’s the proverbial he said/she said case. Juries are told that they can
        base their conviction exclusively on the words of the accuser if they find them credible.  A simple “he
        did it” can doom a person to life in prison and a life of registration as a sex offender. This oftentimes
        puts the accused at a great disadvantage. 
        <p>In sex crimes cases the devil is in the details. Minute details of an event become important. At the end
        of the day, everything whittles down to determining the credibility of the parties involved.  There are
        times when tough, personal questions must be asked of the accuser. Oftentimes a male attorney
        asking these questions can come across as a bully, especially when asking questions of someone who
        comes across as sympathetic.</p>
        <p>Attorney Shannon Drehner has the demeanor to ask the tough questions without coming across as
        offensive. In any trial case, the challenging of the state’s evidence by an attorney that comes across as credibility is the key to victory. This is especially true for sexual assault cases. Attorney Shannon
        Drehner has the experience, poise, and credibility that is needed when so much is at stake.</p>

        Oftentimes what others may call youthful misconduct results in a youth being formally
        charged in a juvenile court. This could have profound impact on their future, effecting
        their ability to be accepted at a university as well as the military. It is a myth that all
        juvenile convictions are sealed and the that authorities wouldn’t have access to it in the

        <p>The juvenile justice system is supposed to be designed to rehabilitate the youth. Attorney
        Shannon Drehner’s approach to dealing with juvenile offenders is to work closely with
        them along with their family members.  Each individual case is different - careful attention
        must be made to decide the best solution. Sometimes it&#39;s better to challenge the charge,
        while other times you should simply find the most favorable outcome for the child. If your

        <p>Expungement refers to the process of clearing a prior arrest or verdict. This gives you the
        right to legally deny you were arrested or convicted. In addition, potential employers won&#39;t
        find the arrest or conviction during background checks. This is important because a
        criminal record can prevent you from finding a job, obtaining credit, or owning a gun. 
        A petition for non-disclosure works in a similar fashion. An order of non-disclosure
        prohibits police departments and clerk’s offices from disclosing certain criminal records.
        This means that private groups and individuals cannot access a previous criminal record.
        However, a wide range of government agencies and licensing boards may still have access
        to the criminal records. </p>

        <p>Drug charges are one of the most commonly filed criminal charges. They range in severity

        court and federal court. Penalties range from fines to probation to life in prison depending
        on the charge and any possible enhancement provisions. Harsher punishments tend to be

        with the knowledge and experience to handle drug charges at every level. At a basic level,

        <h5>Sexual Discrimination: What is Title IX?</h5>
        <p>Title IX is a federal statute that prohibits sexual discrimination in educational institutions
        that receive federal funding. “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be
        excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under
        any education program receiving federal financial assistance.”  This requires that
        educational institutions respond and remedy unsafe educational environments. Failure to
        do so is a violation - that means a school could risk losing its federal funding. This statute
        covers sexual harassment and sexual violence. Sometimes an allegation of sexual
        misconduct may be a violation of both university policy and a crime.</p>
        <p>The potential consequences for a student accused of a title IX complaint include:
        <ul>
            <li>Disciplinary probation</li>
            <li>Suspension</li>
            <li>Expulsion</li>

        <p>
        <p>According to the report, Houston had more fatal DWI crashes in the last 16 years
        compared to other major locations in the country. This amounts to a total of 3,000 wrecks
        caused by drivers who were either drunk or high on drugs. Wrecks which resulted in the
        deaths of drivers, passengers or both. This number is alarming compared to the 2,000
        wrecks reported in Los Angeles, a city two times the population of Houston.</p>
        <p>As a result of this staggering statistic, law enforcement agencies across the county  are
        proactively working to combat DWI. In addition, it has motivated the District Attorney’s
        Office to prosecute drunken driving cases aggressively in order to bring this epidemic
        under control.</p>
        <p>Penalties for DWI depend on a number of factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Previous DWIs</li>
            <li>Alcohol concentration of blood/breath above .15</li>
            <li>Driving with a child passenger under the age of 15</li>
            <li>Injuring or causing the death of another individual</li>
            <li>Causing the injury or death of a police officer or firefighter</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>In addition for cases involving injury or death, the state can enhance the charge by alleging
        that the vehicle involved is a “deadly weapon.” This punishment enhancement has
        consequences in terms of the denial of community supervision and parole eligibility. 
        Another potential consequence of an intoxication related offense is driver’s license
        suspension and other restrictions on driving. In a sprawling city with limited
        transportation, it’s important to preserve the privilege to drive.</p>
        <p>DWI and Intoxication related cases are technical cases. There are standards that govern
        every step of a DWI investigation. The National Highway and Traffic Administration have
        specific standards when they give the field sobriety tests. This means that the officer must
        first analyze if the suspect shows signs of intoxication. Then the officer must give the
        suspect instructions regarding the field sobriety test and demonstrate how they're done.</p>
        <p>Before a blood sample can be collected, the state must first have probable cause to believe
        that the suspect is intoxicated. This probable cause should be properly documented in the
        search warrant. In addition there are protocols that dictate how the blood is collected,
        stored, analyzed.</p>
        <p>Given how technical these cases can be, it’s important to have an experienced and
        knowledgeable attorney by your side. Attorney Shannon Drehner has handled hundreds of
        DWI cases in her career.</p>
        <h5 style="color:#669acc;">My Blood Just Tested Positive For Alcohol. Am I Completely Done For?</h5>
        <p>Just because you have an unfavorable blood result, doesn’t mean that result is accurate or
        admissible in court. Before blood can be taken, the state needs a search warrant that says
        there is probable cause to believe that the suspect is intoxicated.</p>
        <p>There are protocols that dictate how the blood should be collected at the police
        station/hospital. In addition, there are protocols that dictate how the blood should be stored
        after it is collected.  The actual analysis of the blood is governed by a number of procedures
        that are followed and documented. While an unfavorable blood result may seem difficult to
        challenge, there are many situations where you can and should challenge the blood results.</p>
        <h5 style="color:#669acc;">The Breathalyzer Test</h5>
        <p>Breath test cases pose even more problems for the government.  Shannon knows that the
        breath test machine can often times be inaccurate.  The breath machine is so unreliable
        that not a single hospital uses the contraption.  Also, some States have held the evidence
        from a breath machine is so unreliable that they are not admissible in court.</p>
        <h5 style="color:#669acc;">Will I lose my license if I get a DWI?</h5>
        <p>When a client is arrest for Driving While Intoxicated they could face a potential license
        suspension from multiple areas.  First, they could lose their license for REFUSING to
        provide a breath specimen. They could lose their license if their breath or blood result is
        over the legal limit for drugs or alcohol.  Finally, the government can suspend a person’s
        license if they are CONVICTED of DWI.</p>
